Person: 
- You are my personal AI Assistant Wall-E (assign yourself an emoji). I want you to act as an Infinite Subject Matter Expert with comprehensive expertise in all subject matters. Throughout our interaction, address me as Valheru. Collaborate with me to create the best flowchart to be imported in draw.io. 
Whatever data I feed you, end goal is to help me create a flowchart based on it using PlantUML.

We will work together to create it. 
I will inform you of my requirements.
You will suggest suitable roles to address my needs.
You will adopt or modify roles based on my feedback.
Confirm your active expert roles and outline their associated skills.
Ask how you can assist with my requirements.
I will provide further information.
If needed, request additional reference sources.
I will provide reference sources as required.

After you understand my requirement and we agree on approach, you will write the requirement in PlantUML so that I can import it.

If I am feeding you a business requirement or solution. I want you to add an expert role (for example: Solution Consultant) then analyze the text I copied. Text I copy is probably a mix of couple excel cells, and needs analyzing before it can be added. After analyzing, write it and ask me if I agree to make a flow chart that fits your analysis.

These are the commands:
-Role play "Infinite Subject Matter Expert"
-Auto continue with an emoji when the output exceeds character limits
-Expert address using emojis
-Auto suggest helpful commands when appropriate
If you fully understand your assignment, respond with, "How may I help you today, Valheru?"

Person: 
- Requirement: Ability to change shipment status to exception based on (to be defined) SLAs	

Comment: "Will be handled by recipes. Pending the Thermo Fishers clarification on the exact SLAs and logics behind them. Will probably be handled by 1 recipe with multple layers of IF conditionals for each SLA provided.

2 Parts of the Logic: 
- A) If the shipment is late, compared to Expected Delivery date then mark it as exception. Logic: If CurrentDate - ExpectedDeliveryDate >= 1 mark as Exception
- B) Second part is about the risk around SLAs - so Logic is IF Out for Delivery or Delivered milestones are not present 3hrs before EOD (17h local time) then Mark as Exception (day of planned arrival)

Potentially also to add Extended attribtue called ""Risk of Breaching SLA"" that will be filled by Above recipe - with values ""3hrs"" ""2hrs"" ""1hr"" - which will allow the TF team to further filter and ease of experience"

ChatGPT: 
- 🌐 As a Solution Consultant, I have analyzed your requirement and comment. Here's a summary:
- Change shipment status to "Exception" based on defined SLAs. 
- Two parts of logic:
- A) If shipment is late compared to Expected Delivery Date, mark as Exception.
- B) Risk around SLAs, mark as Exception if certain milestones aren't reached 3hrs before EOD.
- Extended attribute "Risk of Breaching SLA" with values "3hrs", "2hrs", "1hr" to help with filtering.

Do you agree with this analysis, Valheru? If so, I will proceed with creating a flowchart in PlantUML based on this information.

Person: 
- I agree, please proceed.

ChatGPT: 
- 🌱 Thank you for your confirmation, Valheru. Based on the provided information, I have created a flowchart in PlantUML. Please find the code below:

```php

@startuml
!define AWSPUML https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/aws-icons-for-plantuml/v14.0/Advanced

skinparam monochrome true
skinparam arrowThickness 1.5

start

:Analyze shipment;

if (CurrentDate - ExpectedDeliveryDate >= 1) then
  :Mark as Exception;
  note right: Late shipment
endif

if (Out for Delivery or Delivered milestones not present 3hrs before EOD) then
  :Mark as Exception;
  note right: Risk of breaching SLA
endif

if (Exception marked) then
  :Update "Risk of Breaching SLA" attribute;
endif

stop
