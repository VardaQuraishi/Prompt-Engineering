Can you write me a cmd command that will run in all the subfolders of the location, and resize all the images to 640x480. Is that possible?

Yes, you can use a combination of command-line tools to achieve this. In this case, I'll suggest using ImageMagick, a powerful, free, and open-source software suite for image manipulation. If you haven't already, download and install ImageMagick from their website ([https://imagemagick.org/](https://imagemagick.org/" target="_new)) before proceeding.
Once you have ImageMagick installed, open the Command Prompt (cmd) and navigate to the folder containing the subfolders with images. Run the following command:
```batch
for /r %i in (*.jpg,*.jpeg,*.png,*.gif) do magick "%i" -resize 640x480^ -gravity center -extent 640x480 "%~dpni_640x480%~xi"

```
This command will:
1. Recursively search for all image files with the extensions .jpg, .jpeg, .png, and .gif in the current folder and all its subfolders.
2. Use ImageMagick's "magick" command to resize each image to 640x480 pixels, maintaining the aspect ratio and cropping if necessary to fill the new dimensions.
3. Save the resized image with the same name as the original, but with "_640x480" added before the file extension in the same folder as the original image.
Please note that this command will overwrite existing files with the same "_640x480" suffix if they exist. You can adjust the command to include other image file formats by modifying the list of file extensions in the parentheses.
