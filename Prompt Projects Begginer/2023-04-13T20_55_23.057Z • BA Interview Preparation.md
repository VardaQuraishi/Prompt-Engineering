Overview


We are a company called Digital ABC and we sell T-shirts with custom prints online. We keep our customer requests/deals in HubSpot. Currently, we create a HubSpot deal for each customer request. Also, we use QuickBooks online for invoicing.



We want to keep all our orders and invoice information in a new Airtable base, which does not exist at this point. The order should be created in Airtable once the deposit invoice (50% of the order amount) is sent to the customer. 



Current Process (AS IS)


Currently, we create a HubSpot Deal in the Pre-Sale pipeline for each customer request. 



The HubSpot Deal contains the following data:



Customer (HubSpot Contact related to the HubSpot Deal)
Each order contains a max of 10 custom products.
The Qty of each custom product is 1000 pieces in 1 Order.
Before sending the deposit invoice to the customer, we need to have the following order information, including:
T-Shirt Model
Color
Size
Print image (the customers send us the images that they want to print on their T-Shirts or select the image from our catalog)
Qty
Unit Price
Total Amount
Shipping Information
Delivery method


Future Process (To Be)


We want to automate the Airtable Order creation process. When the HubSpot user (our sales team) gets all of the required order information and updates the HubSpot Deal Stage to "Needs Deposit Invoice", the following actions should be done

Quickbooks Invoice for 50% of the Order Amount should be created and emailed to the customer
Airtable records should be created 
Customer (New or match existing by the email address)
First Name
Last Name
Email Address
Shipping Address
Phone Number
SKU record (Create New - if the customer orders the custom print, which doesn't exist in our catalog or we do not have SKU for the ordered size for this print; or match existing by the HubSpot SKU id if the customer picked the image from our catalog)
SKU
image
Size
Color
Order Item (Create new Order Item record for each custom product type)
SKU
Qty
Unit Price
Order record
Customer
Order Items
Delivery Method
Shipping Address
Total Amount

For number 2, flow chart, I want you to create me a table that will visualize the flow. In the table, those cells that dont need to be seen fill them with "N/A"

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Sure, here's a table representation of the flow:

**ChatGPT:**
Here is a user story from the perspective of a salesperson:
Title: Automate Order Creation and Deposit Invoice Generation
<p>As a salesperson,
I want the system to automatically create an order in Airtable and generate a deposit invoice in QuickBooks when I update a HubSpot Deal Stage to "Needs Deposit Invoice,"
So that I can save time and reduce manual data entry, ensuring a smoother process for both our team and our customers.</p>Acceptance Criteria:
1. When the salesperson updates the HubSpot Deal Stage to "Needs Deposit Invoice," the system must fetch the necessary order information from the HubSpot Deal.
2. The system must create a deposit invoice for 50% of the Order Amount in QuickBooks and email it to the customer.
3. The system must check if the customer already exists in Airtable by email address and either retrieve the existing customer ID or create a new customer record with the relevant details.
4. The system must create or match SKU records in Airtable, fetching or updating the SKU details (image, size, color) accordingly.
5. The system must create Order Item records in Airtable for each custom product type, with the associated SKU, quantity, and unit price.
6. The system must create an Order record in Airtable, associating the Customer, Order Items, Delivery Method, Shipping Address, and Total Amount.
7. The salesperson must be able to view the created records and invoice in Airtable and QuickBooks, respectively.
This user story focuses on the salesperson's needs and expectations for the automated process, emphasizing the need to reduce manual data entry and streamline the order creation and invoicing process. The acceptance criteria outline the key steps and requirements for the system to meet these objectives.
