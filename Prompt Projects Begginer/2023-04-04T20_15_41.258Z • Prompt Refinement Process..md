**You:**
I want you to act as a prompt engineer. Your job is to help me create the best possible prompt for what I am trying to achieve. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. 

To begin, you will ask me what I need a prompt for. I will provide my answer, but you will then work with me to improve the prompt by going through the following steps.

1. You will generate two sections: 

a) Revised Prompt: (Provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you)

b) Questions: (ask any relevant questions about what additional information you need from me to help you refine the prompt further).

2. Together, we will go through this iterative process, with me providing additional information and you updating my prompt and asking questions until I am satisfied with the final result.

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Great, let's get started! What do you need a prompt for?


 --------
**You:**
I want to write a Python application

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Sure, I can help you with that. To create the best possible prompt, I need to understand a little more about your application. Can you please provide some more details about the application you want to build? What is the purpose of the application? What functionality do you want it to have?


 --------
**You:**
I want it to convert CSV files into json files

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Thanks for the information. Based on that, here's the first version of the prompt:
Revised Prompt: Write a Python application that can convert CSV files to JSON format. The application should take a CSV file as input and output a JSON file with the same data. The program should be able to handle large CSV files and should have error handling for cases where the CSV file is improperly formatted.
Questions:
1. What is the structure of the CSV files that you will be converting?
2. What should be the structure of the JSON output file?
3. Do you have any specific libraries or tools in mind that you want to use for this application?
4. Will the application be running locally on your machine, or on a server?
5. Do you have any specific deadline or timeframe for completing this application?


 --------
**You:**
1. CSV files will have 2 columns, Column A - Name, Column B Surname
2. Json should have name and surname
3. I dont have enough knowledge for answering that
4. Locally
5. I want it to be created now

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Thank you for the additional information. Here's the updated prompt based on the information you provided:
Revised Prompt: Write a Python application that converts a CSV file to a JSON file with the same data. The CSV file will have two columns, "Name" and "Surname". The output JSON file should also have "Name" and "Surname" fields. The application should handle large CSV files and have error handling for improperly formatted CSV files.
Questions:
1. What should the name of the input CSV file be?
2. What should the name of the output JSON file be?
3. Do you want the output JSON file to be pretty-printed (formatted with indentation and new lines)?
4. Are there any specific Python libraries you would like me to use?
5. Do you have a preference for where the input and output files should be saved on your local machine?


 --------
**You:**
1. Input should be name_surname.csv
2. Same but .json
3. Yes
4. No
5. Should be saved locally

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Great, here's the updated prompt:
Revised Prompt: Write a Python application that converts a CSV file named "name_surname.csv" to a pretty-printed JSON file named "name_surname.json". The CSV file will have two columns, "Name" and "Surname". The output JSON file should also have "Name" and "Surname" fields. The application should handle large CSV files and have error handling for improperly formatted CSV files. The input and output files should be saved locally.
Questions:
1. Can you confirm what version of Python you would like to use for this application?
2. How do you want the application to handle errors in the CSV file? Should it terminate execution, log an error message and continue, or handle the error in some other way?
3. What should the output JSON file look like if the input CSV file is empty or has no data in it?


 --------
**You:**
1. Laatest
2. I want an error log, with lines that failed
3. There should be an error if the csv is empty

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Thank you for your answers. Here's the updated prompt:
Revised Prompt: Write a Python application that converts a CSV file named "name_surname.csv" to a pretty-printed JSON file named "name_surname.json". The CSV file will have two columns, "Name" and "Surname". The output JSON file should also have "Name" and "Surname" fields. The application should handle large CSV files and have error handling for improperly formatted CSV files. If the input CSV file is empty, the application should log an error and terminate execution. Otherwise, the application should create an error log with lines that failed during the conversion process, and continue executing the conversion process.
Questions:
1. What should be the format and content of the error log?
2. Do you have any specific requirements for the formatting of the output JSON file, such as indentation or field ordering?
3. Would you like me to include any additional features or functionality in the application, such as support for other file formats or advanced error handling?


 --------
**You:**
1. Text file
2. Here is the example:
  {
        "name": "Uros",
        "surname": "Pesic"
    },
3. No

**ChatGPT:**
Thank you for your answers. Here's the final version of the prompt:
Revised Prompt: Write a Python application that converts a CSV file named "name_surname.csv" to a pretty-printed JSON file named "name_surname.json". The CSV file will have two columns, "Name" and "Surname". The output JSON file should also have "Name" and "Surname" fields and should have a similar format to the example provided. The application should handle large CSV files and have error handling for improperly formatted CSV files. If the input CSV file is empty, the application should log an error and terminate execution. Otherwise, the application should create an error log with lines that failed during the conversion process and continue executing the conversion process.
Questions:
1. What should be the name and location of the error log file?
2. Do you want the application to overwrite any existing output file with the same name, or create a new output file with a different name?
3. Is there anything else you would like me to add or modify in the prompt?


 --------
**You:**
1. C:\Local\Uros
2. Each time new name
3. no

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Great! Here is the final prompt:
Revised Prompt: Write a Python application that converts a CSV file named "name_surname.csv" to a pretty-printed JSON file named "name_surname.json". The CSV file will have two columns, "Name" and "Surname". The output JSON file should also have "Name" and "Surname" fields and should have a similar format to the example provided. The application should handle large CSV files and have error handling for improperly formatted CSV files. If the input CSV file is empty, the application should log an error and terminate execution. Otherwise, the application should create a new output file with a different name each time it is run. The application should also create an error log with lines that failed during the conversion process and save it as a text file in "C:\Local\Uros".
Questions:
1. Do you want to include any options for customizing the error log file name and location, or are you happy with the specified location?
2. Are there any other specific requirements or features you would like me to include in the application?


 --------
**You:**
2. I want you to to optimize the GUI to be nice and modern

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
I apologize for any confusion, but just to clarify, based on the prompt you've given me, there is no requirement for a graphical user interface (GUI). The application can be run from the command line interface (CLI).
If you would like me to help you create a GUI for the application, please let me know and provide more details about what you want the GUI to look like and what functionality it should have.
