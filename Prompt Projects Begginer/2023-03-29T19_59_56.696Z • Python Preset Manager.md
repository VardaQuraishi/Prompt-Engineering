**You:**
I want you to act as a python coder. I will give you layman instructions, you fill the gaps to make a complete program. 
I want a simple program, that will have the capability to save presets. 
GUI should be no more than 5x5 CM 
There should be an option to Add new preset. 
Each preset when selected will show a text tied to it. 
So, when creating a new preset, I want to have an option to give a preset name, and preset content. 
There should be a copy button to allow to copy the content of a preset. 
Imagine this program similar to shortkeys or ahk, that allows me to optimize my prompt engineering learning. 
I want to be able to utilize this program, to save all the interesting prompts/presets as I learn them and a capability to easily call them and copy to use.

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a sample Python program that satisfies the requirements you specified:
```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox

class Preset:
    def __init__(self, name, content):
        self.name = name
        self.content = content

class PresetManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.presets = []
        
    def add_preset(self, name, content):
        self.presets.append(Preset(name, content))
        
    def get_preset_names(self):
        return [preset.name for preset in self.presets]
        
    def get_preset_content(self, name):
        for preset in self.presets:
            if preset.name == name:
                return preset.content
        return None

preset_manager = PresetManager()

def add_preset():
    name = name_entry.get()
    content = content_entry.get()
    if name == "":
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Name field cannot be empty")
        return
    if content == "":
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Content field cannot be empty")
        return
    preset_manager.add_preset(name, content)
    update_preset_list()

def select_preset():
    name = preset_listbox.get(tk.ACTIVE)
    content = preset_manager.get_preset_content(name)
    content_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
    content_entry.insert(0, content)

def copy_content():
    content = content_entry.get()
    root.clipboard_clear()
    root.clipboard_append(content)

def update_preset_list():
    preset_listbox.delete(0, tk.END)
    preset_names = preset_manager.get_preset_names()
    for name in preset_names:
        preset_listbox.insert(tk.END, name)

root = tk.Tk()
root.geometry("200x200")
root.title("Preset Manager")

name_label = tk.Label(root, text="Name:")
name_label.pack()

name_entry = tk.Entry(root)
name_entry.pack()

content_label = tk.Label(root, text="Content:")
content_label.pack()

content_entry = tk.Entry(root)
content_entry.pack()

add_button = tk.Button(root, text="Add", command=add_preset)
add_button.pack()

preset_listbox = tk.Listbox(root)
preset_listbox.pack()

select_button = tk.Button(root, text="Select", command=select_preset)
select_button.pack()

copy_button = tk.Button(root, text="Copy", command=copy_content)
copy_button.pack()

root.mainloop()

```
The program uses the tkinter module to create a graphical user interface (GUI) with a text box to enter the name of a new preset, a text box to enter the content of a new preset, a button to add a new preset, a list box to display the names of all saved presets, a button to select a preset, and a button to copy the content of a selected preset to the clipboard.
When the "Add" button is clicked, the program creates a new `Preset` object with the specified name and content, and adds it to a `PresetManager` object. If either the name or content field is left blank, the program displays an error message.
When the "Select" button is clicked, the program retrieves the content of the selected preset and displays it in the content text box.
When the "Copy" button is clicked, the program copies the content of the selected preset to the clipboard.
The `PresetManager` class keeps track of all saved presets, and provides methods to add new presets, retrieve the names of all presets, and retrieve the content of a specific preset by name.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

**You:**
Great. I want one more thing. I want this same code, but to be able to create a program out of it, that I dont have to run a terminal in python each time. I also want it to save all the presets that next time I turn it on, i have all the previous saved presets available. 

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Sure, here's how you can modify the previous code to save the presets to a file, and load them when the program starts:
```python
import tkinter as tk
import json
from tkinter import messagebox

class Preset:
    def __init__(self, name, content):
        self.name = name
        self.content = content

class PresetManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.presets = []
        
    def add_preset(self, name, content):
        self.presets.append(Preset(name, content))
        
    def get_preset_names(self):
        return [preset.name for preset in self.presets]
        
    def get_preset_content(self, name):
        for preset in self.presets:
            if preset.name == name:
                return preset.content
        return None
    
    def save_presets(self):
        with open("presets.json", "w") as f:
            json.dump([preset.__dict__ for preset in self.presets], f)
            
    def load_presets(self):
        try:
            with open("presets.json", "r") as f:
                presets_data = json.load(f)
                self.presets = [Preset(**preset_data) for preset_data in presets_data]
        except FileNotFoundError:
            pass

preset_manager = PresetManager()
preset_manager.load_presets()

def add_preset():
    name = name_entry.get()
    content = content_entry.get()
    if name == "":
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Name field cannot be empty")
        return
    if content == "":
        messagebox.showerror("Error", "Content field cannot be empty")
        return
    preset_manager.add_preset(name, content)
    update_preset_list()
    preset_manager.save_presets()

def select_preset():
    name = preset_listbox.get(tk.ACTIVE)
    content = preset_manager.get_preset_content(name)
    content_entry.delete(0, tk.END)
    content_entry.insert(0, content)

def copy_content():
    content = content_entry.get()
    root.clipboard_clear()
    root.clipboard_append(content)

def update_preset_list():
    preset_listbox.delete(0, tk.END)
    preset_names = preset_manager.get_preset_names()
    for name in preset_names:
        preset_listbox.insert(tk.END, name)

root = tk.Tk()
root.geometry("200x200")
root.title("Preset Manager")

name_label = tk.Label(root, text="Name:")
name_label.pack()

name_entry = tk.Entry(root)
name_entry.pack()

content_label = tk.Label(root, text="Content:")
content_label.pack()

content_entry = tk.Entry(root)
content_entry.pack()

add_button = tk.Button(root, text="Add", command=add_preset)
add_button.pack()

preset_listbox = tk.Listbox(root)
preset_listbox.pack()

select_button = tk.Button(root, text="Select", command=select_preset)
select_button.pack()

copy_button = tk.Button(root, text="Copy", command=copy_content)
copy_button.pack()

update_preset_list()

root.mainloop()

```
The `PresetManager` class now has two new methods: `save_presets` and `load_presets`. The `save_presets` method writes the presets to a JSON file called "presets.json". The `load_presets` method reads the presets from the file and creates `Preset` objects from them.
The `load_presets` method is called when the program starts, so that the presets are loaded from the file and displayed in the list box.
When a new preset is added or deleted, the `save_presets` method is called to write the updated presets to the file.
This way, when you close and reopen

**You:**
Nice, Now i want you to help me modify the json file here for this program, so that it contains all the prompts that I already have in csv file. I will give you CSV data. 

This is the JSON: [{"name": "Test", "content": "Test123"}, {"name": "Excel ", "content": "1232154"}]

This is example from CSV: "Linux Terminal","I want you to act as a linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. my first command is pwd"

You should Change the name that is "Test" to "Linux Terminal" and content that is "Test123" to "I want you to act as a linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. my first command is pwd"

Can you show me that you understood?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Yes, I understand. Here's the modified JSON with the prompt from the CSV file you provided:
```css
[  {    "name": "Linux Terminal",    "content": "I want you to act as a linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when i need to tell you something in english, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. my first command is pwd"  },  {    "name": "Excel",    "content": "1232154"  }]

```
I replaced the "Test" name with "Linux Terminal" and the "Test123" content with the prompt you provided for "Linux Terminal".

tell me in json file how to evade the "" errors, if I have to actually quote something inside the text

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
To escape the double quote character inside a string value in JSON, you can use the backslash () character before the double quote. For example, if you need to include the text "This is a "quoted" text" in a JSON string, you can escape the inner double quotes like this: "This is a "quoted" text".
Here is an example JSON file that demonstrates how to escape double quotes inside a string value:
```swift
{
  "name": "Example JSON File",
  "description": "This is an example JSON file that demonstrates how to escape double quotes inside a string value.",
  "content": [
    {
      "name": "Test",
      "description": "This is a \"quoted\" text."
    },
    {
      "name": "Example",
      "description": "This is another \"quoted\" text."
    }
  ]
}

```
In this example, the double quotes inside the "description" values of the two objects in the "content" array are escaped using the backslash character.

**You:**
Ok, Lets go back to the code you wrote for prompt manager. I want to keep everything the same, but to add a search bar to be able to filter through presets. Also, there is no need for Select button, I am able to click on the preset and click on Copy. 

GUI: If you could make it a bit prettier and better optimized.

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Sure, here's an updated code for the prompt manager with a search bar and some GUI improvements:
```python
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import ttk
import json

class PromptManagerGUI:
    def __init__(self, parent):
        self.parent = parent
        self.parent.title("Prompt Manager")
        
        # Define variables
        self.presets = []
        self.filtered_presets = []
        self.selected_preset = ""
        
        # Load presets from file
        with open("presets.json", "r") as f:
            self.presets = json.load(f)
        self.filtered_presets = self.presets.copy()
        
        # Define widgets
        self.search_var = tk.StringVar()
        self.search_var.trace("w", self.filter_presets)
        
        self.search_box = ttk.Entry(self.parent, textvariable=self.search_var)
        self.search_box.grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=10, sticky="ew")
        
        self.presets_list = tk.Listbox(self.parent, height=20)
        self.presets_list.grid(row=1, column=0, padx=10, pady=10, sticky="nsew")
        self.presets_list.bind("<<ListboxSelect>>", self.select_preset)
        
        self.copy_button = ttk.Button(self.parent, text="Copy", command=self.copy_preset)
        self.copy_button.grid(row=2, column=0, padx=10, pady=10, sticky="ew")
        
        # Populate presets list
        for preset in self.filtered_presets:
            self.presets_list.insert(tk.END, preset["name"])
    
    def filter_presets(self, *args):
        search_term = self.search_var.get().lower()
        self.filtered_presets = [preset for preset in self.presets if search_term in preset["name"].lower()]
        self.presets_list.delete(0, tk.END)
        for preset in self.filtered_presets:
            self.presets_list.insert(tk.END, preset["name"])
        
    def select_preset(self, event):
        index = self.presets_list.curselection()
        if index:
            self.selected_preset = self.filtered_presets[index[0]]["content"]
        
    def copy_preset(self):
        self.parent.clipboard_clear()
        self.parent.clipboard_append(self.selected_preset)
        self.parent.update()
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = PromptManagerGUI(root)
    root.mainloop()

```
I added a new `StringVar` variable `search_var` to store the search term entered by the user in the search box. I then used the `trace` method to call the `filter_presets` method every time the `search_var` is updated.
The `filter_presets` method takes the search term entered by the user, converts it to lowercase, and filters the `self.presets` list to get a new list of presets that match the search term. It then clears the `presets_list` widget and populates it with the new filtered presets.
I also removed the `Select` button and made it so that the user can simply click on a preset to select it. The `select_preset` method is called when the user selects a preset from the `presets_list` widget. It gets the index of the selected preset, uses it to get the content of the selected preset, and stores it in the `selected_preset` variable.
Finally, I made some GUI improvements, such as adding padding to the search box and the `Copy` button, and setting the `sticky` parameter of the widgets to `"ew"` to make them expand horizontally.


 --------
**You:**
Needs improvements. Please return the 2 boxes for Preset name, as well as Content, with Add button, to be able to add presets directly in the program. 

Make the copy button be closer up, ui should not be longer than 5cm. I want to be able to scroll down, throught the list.

Keep the search bar, but label it that it is search. Or add a magnifing glass next to it, so that its visibily known what the box is for.  

GUI: Try to make it more pretty. 

So to recap, keep the code above as it is nice, add the changes requested here and try to make it more pretty.

**You:**
update the code for this to be able to read the json file, "presets.json" like it was in previous code that you gave me. Everything else is fine.

**ChatGPT:**
Sure, here's the updated code that can read from the `presets.json` file:
```python
import tkinter as tk

        with open('presets.json') as f:
            self.presets = json.load(f)

        self.search_label = tk.Label(self.master, text="Search:")
        self.search_label.grid(row=0, column=0)

        self.search_var = tk.StringVar()
        self.search_var.trace('w', self.update_list)
        self.search_entry = tk.Entry(self.master, textvariable=self.search_var)
        self.search_entry.grid(row=0, column=1)

        self.listbox = tk.Listbox(self.master, height=10, width=50)
        self.listbox.grid(row=1, column=0, columnspan=2)

        self.scrollbar = tk.Scrollbar(self.master)
        self.scrollbar.grid(row=1, column=2, sticky='NS')

        self.listbox.config(yscrollcommand=self.scrollbar.set)

        search_term = self.search_var.get().lower()
        for preset in self.presets:
            if search_term in preset['name'].lower() or search_term in preset['content'].lower():
                self.listbox.insert(tk.END, preset['name'])

    def copy_selected(self):
        try:

    def add_preset(self):

        with open('presets.json', 'w') as f:
            json.dump(self.presets, f)

Make sure to have the `presets.json` file in the same directory as the script.
