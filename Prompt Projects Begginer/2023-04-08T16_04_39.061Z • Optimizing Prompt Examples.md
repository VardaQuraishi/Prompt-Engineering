**You:**
Can I teach you how to optimize prompts. I will give you example 1 - which is unoptimized and example 2 which is optimized:

1. Who is better president Trump or Biden?

2. Please provide a detailed comparison of the leadership qualities and skills possessed by both Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Your response should be objective, balanced, and based on factual evidence rather than personal opinions or biases.

Please consider factors such as their experience in public office, ability to communicate effectively with diverse audiences, track record of making difficult decisions under pressure, approach to foreign policy and national security issues, commitment to social justice and equality, and overall vision for the country's future.

Your response should not endorse one candidate over the other but instead provide an informative analysis that helps readers make informed decisions about the candidates' suitability for leadership.

Do you understand why is the second prompt optimized? Let's think step by step.

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Yes, I understand why the second prompt is optimized compared to the first prompt. The first prompt is a closed-ended question that only requires a one-word answer, whereas the second prompt is open-ended and provides clear guidance on what kind of information is expected in the response. The second prompt is also more specific in terms of the kind of information that should be included in the response, including various factors that are relevant to evaluating the leadership qualities of the two candidates. Additionally, the second prompt emphasizes the importance of providing an objective analysis based on factual evidence rather than personal biases or opinions. Overall, the second prompt provides a more comprehensive and informative framework for a detailed comparison of the two presidential candidates.

Lets do the same excercise, I will write the simple prompt, you will give me an optimized version of it. Act as a prompt expert, so that you can fill in the gaps. 

My prompt: I want to create a script that will help me with small investments

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Optimized prompt:
Please provide a detailed description of the specific features and functionalities you are looking for in a script to assist you with small investments. Your response should include information on the types of investments you plan to make, your investment goals, your risk tolerance, and any other relevant factors that should be considered when designing the script. Additionally, please specify any technical requirements or constraints that need to be taken into account when developing the script, such as the programming language, operating system, or hardware platforms that will be used. Your response should not only outline the scope and requirements of the project but also provide insights into the broader context and purpose of the script, including how it will fit into your overall investment strategy and decision-making process.

**You:**
Now act as a Python Coder that has stock market experience. You write me an example prompt for a good script

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Sure, here's an example prompt for a script that can help with small investments, assuming that the investor is interested in using Python for their analysis and has experience with stock market investing:
Optimized prompt:
I am interested in building a Python script that can help me analyze stock market data and make informed decisions about small investments. The script should be able to scrape data from reliable sources, such as financial news websites or APIs, and provide real-time updates on market trends and stock prices. It should also be able to perform technical analysis on the data, using various indicators and metrics to identify patterns and trends in the market. In addition, the script should incorporate risk management tools, such as stop-loss orders or position sizing calculations, to help me mitigate potential losses and optimize my returns. Finally, the script should be user-friendly and easily customizable, allowing me to adjust the parameters and settings to reflect my individual investment goals and preferences. As an experienced Python developer and stock market investor, I would appreciate any suggestions or best practices for building a robust and reliable script that can help me achieve my investment objectives.
