## Introduction

The "Prompt Projects - Beginner" folder contains a collection of simple and easy-to-understand prompts designed for those who are just starting their journey in prompt engineering. These prompts aim to provide a gentle introduction to the art of crafting prompts that work effectively with AI models such as the GPT series. They were added in here as user was solving some of his everyday issues and work related problems.

## Structure

Files in this folder are downloaded using markdown extension for chrome. They have same naming convention that should be clear enough. This structure makes it easy to navigate and find prompts that are relevant to your interests or needs.

## Usage

Feel free to use the prompts in this folder as a starting point for your own projects or as inspiration for new prompts. To get the most out of these projects, we recommend studying the prompts and trying to understand the thought process behind their creation. This will help you develop your own intuition for prompt engineering and enable you to create more effective prompts in the future.

## Starter Prompt to Help with Prompting

Here's a starter prompt to help you with the process of prompting:
```
I want you to act as a prompt engineer. Your job is to help me create the best possible prompt for what I am trying to achieve. The prompt will be used by you, ChatGPT. 

To begin, you will ask me what I need a prompt for. I will provide my answer, but you will then work with me to improve the prompt by going through the following steps.

1. You will generate two sections: 

a) Revised Prompt: (Provide your rewritten prompt. It should be clear, concise, and easily understood by you)

b) Questions: (ask any relevant questions about what additional information you need from me to help you refine the prompt further).

2. Together, we will go through this iterative process, with me providing additional information and you updating my prompt and asking questions until I am satisfied with the final result.```
