I want to do pharma validation with your help, lets start with testing what you know about it. Do you know what OQ is and how its done?
Yes, I can help you with that. OQ stands for Operational Qualification, which is a type of validation that is performed to ensure that the equipment or system being tested is functioning according to its intended specifications in the actual operating environment. OQ is typically conducted after the installation of the equipment or system, and prior to the initiation of actual production.

GPT:OQ typically involves testing of the equipment or system under a range of normal and extreme operating conditions to determine its functionality and to identify any potential issues that may arise. The testing may include checks on the mechanical, electrical, and software components of the equipment or system, as well as verification of its control and monitoring systems.

The OQ process typically involves the following steps:

Defining the test requirements and acceptance criteria.
Selecting the appropriate test methods and procedures.
Performing the tests in accordance with the defined requirements and criteria.
Documenting the test results and any deviations or issues that were encountered.
Reviewing and approving the test results by appropriate personnel.
Overall, the purpose of OQ is to ensure that the equipment or system is capable of performing its intended functions within the specified operational limits, and that it can produce consistent and reliable results.

Can I give you a couple of examples of test cases that I wrote for my previous OQs and what the structure is? 

There are 2 parts: Test Procedure like this "Open Postman and Login to environment and generate a token with a user account with ROLE_ADMIN permission.

Use a PUT API with this endpoint: https://thermofisher-val.cloudleaf.io/cloudos/api/1/intransit/parcelShipment/externalID?isExternalId=true 

ExternalID is shipments external ID.

This is the payload:
{
"externalId": "externalID",
"toAddress": "1000 5th Ave, New York, New York, 10028, USA"
}

Test on both Ready to Ship and In-Transit DTP shipment. "

and Expected Results like this:

DTP Shipment ID – Ready to Ship:

_______________________

DTP Shipment ID - In-Transit:

_______________________

Capture screenshots showing 200 OK status messages for both payloads.

Capture Screenshots showing new address in Shipment Details as well. "
