**You:**
I want to do pharma validation with your help, lets start with testing what you know about it. Do you know what OQ is and how its done?

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Yes, I can help you with that. OQ stands for Operational Qualification, which is a type of validation that is performed to ensure that the equipment or system being tested is functioning according to its intended specifications in the actual operating environment. OQ is typically conducted after the installation of the equipment or system, and prior to the initiation of actual production.
OQ typically involves testing of the equipment or system under a range of normal and extreme operating conditions to determine its functionality and to identify any potential issues that may arise. The testing may include checks on the mechanical, electrical, and software components of the equipment or system, as well as verification of its control and monitoring systems.
The OQ process typically involves the following steps:
1. Defining the test requirements and acceptance criteria.
2. Selecting the appropriate test methods and procedures.
3. Performing the tests in accordance with the defined requirements and criteria.
4. Documenting the test results and any deviations or issues that were encountered.
5. Reviewing and approving the test results by appropriate personnel.
Overall, the purpose of OQ is to ensure that the equipment or system is capable of performing its intended functions within the specified operational limits, and that it can produce consistent and reliable results.


 --------
**You:**
Can I give you a couple of examples of test cases that I wrote for my previous OQs and what the structure is? 

There are 2 parts: Test Procedure like this "Open Postman and Login to environment and generate a token with a user account with ROLE_ADMIN permission.

Use a PUT API with this endpoint: https://thermofisher-val.cloudleaf.io/cloudos/api/1/intransit/parcelShipment/externalID?isExternalId=true 

ExternalID is shipments external ID.

This is the payload:
{
"externalId": "externalID",
"toAddress": "1000 5th Ave, New York, New York, 10028, USA"
}

Test on both Ready to Ship and In-Transit DTP shipment. "

and Expected Results like this:

DTP Shipment ID â€“ Ready to Ship:

_______________________

DTP Shipment ID - In-Transit:

_______________________

Capture screenshots showing 200 OK status messages for both payloads.

Capture Screenshots showing new address in Shipment Details as well. "

Do you understand the example? Can you give me a set of test cases for web platform testing. Lets do Test Case 01 - Login to the platform! (Do negative test case as well)


 --------
**ChatGPT:**

Nice! Lets go to test case 02. This test case should be about Thermo Fisher branding and whitelabeling. Purpose is to show that the platform is correctly branded with customer's logo and colors. Login page should also be branded as well as new user verification email as well as password reset email. Keep the same format, but color the Test Procedure and Expected results lines in red if possible.

 --------

Next test case. We will test the first workspace in the platform called "Assets". In this workspace user can see the asset listing, all the columns with information like "asset name, id, cost etc". We need to test both positive and negative cases. Adding, Editing, Deleting, Binding a Sensor, Unbinding a Sensor. We also need to check if its possible to customize the view of columns, by uncheking unecessary ones. 

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Sure, here are the test cases for Test Case 03 - Assets Workspace:
Test Procedure:
1. Navigate to the "Assets" workspace in the platform.
2. Verify that the asset listing displays all relevant columns, such as "asset name", "id", "cost", etc.
3. Add a new asset to the listing and verify that it appears in the table with correct information.
4. Edit an existing asset in the listing and verify that the changes are saved and displayed correctly.
5. Delete an existing asset from the listing and verify that it is removed from the table.
6. Bind a sensor to an existing asset and verify that the sensor information is displayed correctly in the table.
7. Unbind a sensor from an existing asset and verify that the sensor information is removed from the table.
8. Customize the view of columns by unchecking unnecessary ones and verify that the changes are saved and displayed correctly.
Expected Results:
* The asset listing should display all relevant columns and information correctly.* Adding, editing, deleting, binding, and unbinding assets and sensors should be possible and the changes should be saved and displayed correctly.* Customizing the view of columns by unchecking unnecessary ones should be possible and the changes should be saved and displayed correctly.

Add a test case to test Filters and search function. Also a mix of both

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Sure, here's an additional test case for Test Case 03 - Assets Workspace:
Test Procedure:
1. Navigate to the "Assets" workspace in the platform.
2. Use the search function to search for a specific asset by name or ID.
3. Verify that the asset appears in the search results and that the information displayed is correct.
4. Apply a filter to the asset listing, such as by cost or location.
5. Verify that the asset listing is filtered correctly and that only the assets that meet the filter criteria are displayed.
6. Use the search function again to search for an asset that matches the filter criteria.
7. Verify that the asset appears in the search results and that the information displayed is correct.
Expected Results:
* The search function should be able to find specific assets by name or ID, and display the correct information in the search results.* Applying a filter to the asset listing should filter the table correctly and display only the assets that meet the filter criteria.* Using the search function to search for an asset that matches the filter criteria should find the asset and display the correct information in the search results.

**You:**
Lets modify the expected results for future test cases. So this is what you wrote:
"Expected Results:

The search function should be able to find specific assets by name or ID, and display the correct information in the search results."

I need something like this:

Expected Results:

Screenshot captured showing that search function is working and correct information is captured"

Accent is on Screenshot, since this is a software validation I need to grab screenshot of each result and add it to evidence template. Is that understood?

Lets regenerate the whole Test Case 03. Add the Search and Filtering with the other ones. 

 --------
**ChatGPT:**
Understood! Here's the updated Test Case 03:
Test Case 03 - Assets Workspace
